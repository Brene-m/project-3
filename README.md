# Business Question
Where are wells needing repair locating?
What is the patterns in non-functional wells to influence how new wells are built?
What is the predicted the condition of a water wells?
# Data Understanding and Analysis
## Requirements
An anaconda environment to run the models
The Jupyter Notebook that should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling. It begins with a basic model, and then provides justification. The provides 1-3 paragraphs discussing the final model.
The deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process.
