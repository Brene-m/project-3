# Tanzanian Water Well Project
Tanzania, as a developing country, struggles with providing clean water to its population of over 57,000,000.
# Business Understanding
There are many water points already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether hence help the NGO to locate and find patterns in non-functional water wells and find patterns in non-functional wells to influence how new wells are built.
*classifiations include:
-Functional wells
-Functional and needs repair wells
-Non-functional wells
# Business Question
Where are wells needing repair locating?
What is the patterns in non-functional wells to influence how new wells are built?
What is the predicted the condition of a water wells?
# Data Understanding and Analysis
## Requirements
An anaconda environment to run the models
The Jupyter Notebook that should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling. It begins with a basic model, and then provides justification. The provides 1-3 paragraphs discussing the final model.
The deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process.
